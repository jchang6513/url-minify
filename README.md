# url-minify

`url-minify` is a simple URL shortener application built with Next.js and utilizing Vercel Storage KV for storing the shortened URLs. This application allows users to shorten long URLs and provides a shorter, more convenient version for sharing.

## Features

- Shorten long URLs to a custom-generated, shorter version.
- Access the original URL by using the generated short version.
- Store and manage the shortened URLs in Vercel Storage KV.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Vercel, and you can access it at [https://your-app-url.vercel.app](https://your-app-url.vercel.app).

## Local Development

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-minify.git
cd url-minify
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```

3. Set up Vercel environment variables:

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
   - Obtain your Vercel Storage KV API token and store it as `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` in the `.env.local` file.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to access the application.

## Configuration
